<h2>FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>It is the duty of all good, useful stories
to give a message to their readers. The
two dainty stories contained in this little
volume each carries its message of truth.
Pure, simple and wholesome in quality,
they cannot fail to refresh as well as instruct
those who receive them.</p>

<p>In the <i>Golden Harvest</i> the lesson of
patience taught by the little apple tree's
experience will bear rich fruit I do not
doubt, and the wisdom of the little brown
hen cannot help but teach us all to listen
for the nightingale's song of harmony in
our own lives.</p>

<div class='cap'>A &nbsp; POMPOUS old gander who lived
in a barn-yard thought himself
wiser than the rest of the creatures,
and so decided to instruct them.</div>

<p>He called together all the fowls in
the barn-yard, and the pigeons off the
barn-roof, and told them to listen to
him.</p>

<p>They gathered around and listened
very earnestly, for they thought they
would learn a great deal of wisdom.</p>

<p>"The first thing for you to learn," said
the gander, "is to speak my language.
It is very silly for you to chatter as you
do. Now we will all say, 'honk!' one,
two, three,&mdash;'honk!'"</p>

<p>The creatures all tried very hard to
say "honk!" but the sounds they made
were so remarkable that I cannot write
them, and none of them sounded like
"honk!"</p>

<p>The gander was very angry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"How stupid you are!" he cried.
"Now you all must practise till you
learn it. Do not let me hear a peep or
cluck or a coo! You must all 'honk'
when you have anything to say."</p>

<p>So they obediently tried to do as he
said.</p>

<p>When the little brown hen laid an
egg, instead of making the fact known
with her sharp little "cut&mdash;cut&mdash;cut-cut-ah-cut!"
as a well-ordered hen
should do, she ran around the barn-yard
trying to say, "honk! honk!"</p>

<p>But nobody heard her, and nobody
came to look for the egg.</p>

<p>The guinea-fowls way down in the
pasture ceased calling "la croik! la
croik!" and there was no way of finding
where they had hid their nests. In
the afternoon, when their shrill cries
should have warned the farmers that
it was going to rain, they were still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
honking, or trying to, so the nicely dried
hay got wet.</p>

<p>Next morning chanticleer, instead of
rousing the place with his lusty crow,
made an effort at honking that could
not be heard a stone's throw away, and
so the whole farm overslept.</p>

<p>All day there was a Babel of sounds
in the barn-yard. The turkeys left off
gobbling and made a queer sound that
they thought was "honk!" the ducks
left off quacking, the chicks left off
peeping, and said nothing at all, for
"honk!" was too big a mouthful for
them; and the soft billing and cooing of
the doves were turned into an ugly
harsh sound.</p>

<p>Things were indeed getting into a
dreadful state, and they grew worse,
instead of better.</p>

<p>The hens forgot to lay eggs, the
doves became proud and pompous like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the gander, and as for the turkey gobblers,
they kept the place in an uproar,
for they thought they could really honk!
and they never ceased from morning
till night.</p>

<p>There's no telling what it all would
have come to if there hadn't been one
in the barn-yard, with an ear that could
hear something besides the dreadful discords.</p>

<p>One night the little brown hen was
roosting alone in the top of the hen-house.
All at once she was awakened by
the sweetest song she had ever heard.</p>

<p>She called to her chicks and to some
of her companions to wake up and
listen; but they were sleepy and soon
dozed off again, so the little brown hen
was left listening alone.</p>

<p>"I will ask the gander what this
beautiful song means," she said. "He
knows everything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>So she awoke the gander and asked
him who was singing the beautiful song,
and what it meant.</p>

<p>The gander said gruffly: "It is the
nightingale. I do not know what her
song means. She should learn to honk!"
And he tucked his head back under his
wing.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought the little brown hen,
"if learning the gander's language does
not help me to understand this beautiful
song, I do not think it is worth
bothering with. I shall never try to say
'honk!' again."</p>

<p>So she went back to her roost and
listened till the nightingale's song
ceased. Then she tucked her head under
her little brown wing and went to
sleep, her little heart singing within
her.</p>

<p>At daylight she awoke, and hopping
down sought her companions, eager to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tell them the wonderful thing that was
singing in her heart.</p>

<p>"This is a beautiful, simple world,"
she cried, "and I have learned a very
wonderful thing!"</p>

<p>But to her surprise, the creatures
had no desire to hear what it was, for
they were all in a flurry getting ready
for their next lesson in honking.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you need not bother about
honking," cried the little brown hen,
but nobody paid any attention to her.</p>

<p>So she called her chicks about her,
and went her way, clucking merrily,
while they picked up bugs, and dared
to peep once more when they found a
nice fat worm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the class in honking
made very little headway, for no sooner
were they settled than they began to
wish they knew what wonderful thing
the little brown hen had to tell.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="366" height="500" alt="THEY&middot;GATHERED&middot;AROUND&middot;AND&middot;LISTENED&middot;VERY&middot;EARNESTLY&middot;&middot;" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>They craned their necks to watch
her, and were filled with envy, seeing
that she and her chicks feasted bountifully,
with very little scratching, whereas
<i>they</i> scratched in the barn-yard all
day, and found only enough bugs to
quarrel over.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said one old rooster, "we
have learned nothing about the best
way of scratching for bugs, with all
our gabbling."</p>

<p>"I should be glad," spoke up a duck,
"to learn the wonderful thing that the
little hen has learned, so <i>I</i> could keep
from quarreling with my neighbors."</p>

<p>They all grew quite uneasy, and the
gander became very angry.</p>

<p>"Such a stupid lot I have never
seen!" he cried. "I have a great mind
to let you go your ways and not bother
with you!" and thereat he dismissed
the class in high dudgeon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing they all did was to
take after the little brown hen.</p>

<p>"What is the wonderful thing you
have learned?" asked the gobblers,
shaking their red throats and looking
very important.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the wise little hen, "I
learned it by listening to the nightingale,
and so can you, I presume, if you leave
off that silly honking. Just gobble as
nicely as you can when you have anything
to say, but first be sure it is worth
saying."</p>

<p>The turkeys wished the little brown
hen would tell them and save them the
trouble of listening, but as they had
paid no attention when she offered,
they had nothing to do but follow her
advice.</p>

<p>So they stopped honking and did
very little gobbling, for they found that
they had not much of importance to say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The ducks and the chickens and the
doves all asked the same question, and
the little brown hen gave them much
the same answer:</p>

<p>"Just quack and coo and cluck as
nicely as you can, and have a care to
lay nice eggs. Attend very strictly to
your own affairs, for I have found that
one learns a great deal by listening."</p>

<p>As they all took her advice, the barn-yard
became a quiet, well-ordered barn-yard
again, with only so much cackling
and clucking, and so forth, as to give it
a business-like air.</p>

<p>For each one was listening to hear
when the nightingale came, and first
thing they knew each one heard the
same song as the little brown hen, for it
was singing in all their hearts, and they
understood it, whether they quacked or
gobbled or cooed.</p>

<p>"It does seem that there's a deal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
talking these days," said the little brown
hen, "and it's mighty hard to listen; but
even if the old gander does honk every
now and then, nobody need pay any
attention to him, for, after all, it isn't always
those with the loudest voices that
have the best things to say."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class='cap'>IN A thriving apple orchard full of
trees richly laden with fruit, stood
one hardy little tree whose apples
remained small and green and hard.</div>

<p>The little tree wondered why her
fruit was so small, when that on the
other trees grew so large and fine.</p>

<p>"But perhaps as these are my first
apples they are slow in ripening," she
thought. "I must be patient and before
long the beautiful color will begin
to appear."</p>

<p>So day after day she watched for
some signs of color on the cheeks of
the hard little apples, and time seemed
to drag more and more slowly.</p>

<p>But life in an apple orchard is not
altogether uneventful, and the little tree
became interested in finding she could
take part in what was going on about
her.</p>

<p>One day there was a curious squawk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in among her branches, and soon two
robins, each with a worm in his mouth,
came flying in through the thick-leaved
boughs, to their nest in a crotch of the
tree.</p>

<p>"Our birdies are hatched!" they cried,
filling the gaping mouths. "The little
tree sheltered our eggs from storm and
sun, and hid them so carefully that no
one could find them. We are safer in
this tree than in any tree in the
orchard."</p>

<p>The little tree was filled with joy at
finding that, after all, there was something
she could do to be of use.</p>

<p>"I have watched the little blue eggs
ever since you left them here," she said;
and she seemed to snuggle her branches
more closely about the nest.</p>

<p>At last the little robins grew strong
enough to fly, and the nest was left
empty, though the young birds stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in the orchard and often came to perch
in the tree, and sing their song of gratitude.</p>

<p>Indeed all the creatures about seemed
to know that here was loving shelter for
them. A little chipmunk made its home
under the rock at the foot of the tree,
and frisked up the trunk and among
the boughs. Many birds perched in the
branches and told wonderful song stories
of what was going on in the world.</p>

<p>A merry little flycatcher chose a
small twig under one of the boughs of
the apple tree, where it perched for
hours, darting out when a fly or other
insect buzzed by; but always returning
to the little twig as if it were home.
In the shade of the thick-leaved boughs,
the friendly cows sought shelter, patiently
chewing their cud, and switching
their tails to shoo off the flies.</p>

<p>And so the earnest little tree did all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
she could to be of use, and was more
beloved, though she did not know it,
than any tree in the orchard. Yet she
could not but think sadly of her little
green apples, that seemed to show no
signs of ripening.</p>

<p>Many long summer days passed.
The early harvest apples in their full
prime were picked and barreled.</p>

<p>Each day the golden pippins grew
more juicy and golden; the big jolly
Ben Davis, wine-saps, northern spies,
bellflowers and many others ripening
in their turn, filled the orchard with a
delightful odor and glow of color; but
the fruit on the one tree seemed as hard
and backward as ever.</p>

<p>The trees with the beautiful fruit
laughed and whispered among themselves,
and the little tree was very
unhappy, for she thought they were
laughing at her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely my fruit <i>must</i> begin to ripen
soon," she thought.</p>

<p>But at night when the rest of the
orchard was asleep, she wept silently
to herself, for she wondered if it could
be possible that her apples would not
ripen at all.</p>

<p>At last summer seemed to hold her
breath. Day after day the warm sunshine
beat down upon the orchard,
drowsy with the richness and fulness
of its almost completed labor. The
trees now and then stirred their heavy
branches, as if suggesting that it was
time to be relieved of their burden.</p>

<p>One day a flock of merry children
came to the orchard to play. The day
was cool, a gentle breeze stirred,&mdash;early
fall had blown its first faint breath.</p>

<p>The children frolicked all day, ate
their luncheon on the grass, shook down
ripe apples, and with the lengthening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
evening shadows, began to gather up
their baskets, happy and contented and
ready to go home.</p>

<p>A cool evening breeze sprang up
with sudden briskness.</p>

<p>"Look at that black cloud!" cried a
little urchin.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rain began to come
down with a brisk patter; the children
scampered quickly under the nearest
tree; the dark cloud overspread the
whole sky, rain pelted down, a great
wind roared through the orchard,
bending the trees, and causing their
branches to wave wildly and a shower
of apples to fall.</p>

<p>"Oh, where shall we go?" cried the
children. "The apples are pelting us,
and the rain drives in upon us."</p>

<p>"Yonder under the little tree with
green apples," cried one. "See how
thickly leaved it is, and how low the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
boughs bend; we shall be well sheltered
there."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="289" height="392" alt="THE WARM SUNSHINE BEAT DOWN UPON THE DROWSY ORCHARD" title="" />
</div>

<p>Quickly they rushed to the tree, and
how gladly she gathered them in, and
kept them dry under her loving arms;
and not one of her apples fell off.</p>

<p>Soon the shower was over, and the
children scampered home, saying:</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we were near
that tree, or we should have been soaking
wet. There isn't another one like it
in the orchard."</p>

<p>The little tree heard their words of
gratitude, and wept for joy.</p>

<p>The next day was bright and warm,
and pleasant sunshiny weather followed.
At last the haze of Indian summer settled
lovingly over the country and the orchard
rang with the voices of men and
boys carrying baskets and ladders.</p>

<p>"Too bad that equinoctial storm
was such a blusterer," said one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
men. "These lazy trees have dropped
much of their fruit, and it lies bruised
on the ground."</p>

<p>But they picked barrel after barrel
of the rich harvest, and soon the little
tree was left alone with her burden of
useless fruit.</p>

<p>Now the trees seemed prouder than
ever, and talked boastfully about the
fine apple harvest <i>they</i> had furnished
for mankind.</p>

<p>The little tree sighed softly to herself.</p>

<p>"But I must not be unhappy," she
said, "for if I cannot bear beautiful red
and golden apples, there is surely some
work for me to do, and I shall find out
what it is."</p>

<p>And now, though the little tree had
not noticed that her apples had grown,
her branches were bending almost to
the ground with their weight. She
tried to shake off some of the apples,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for it seemed to add to her disgrace to
bear so much of this useless fruit. But
she could no more shake them off than
could the wind and storm.</p>

<p>The clear cool fall days were passing,
growing shorter and shorter. The little
tree was very lonely now, for the chipmunk
was snug in his winter home, the
birds had flown south and the cows
now looked for sun instead of shade.
The other trees, having finished their
work, were preparing for their long winter
nap. The little tree way down in the
corner of the orchard seldom saw any
one, but she was stout of heart, and
kept on saying:</p>

<p>"I know I shall find some way to be
of use."</p>

<p>She did not pay much attention to
her apples, for she had long ago given
up hopes of their becoming red and ripe.</p>

<p>Every night now white frost tripped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
daintily over the hardening ground, and
at sunup disappeared; the days were
cool and bright; the frosts grew heavier
and the weather colder.</p>

<p>One day there were voices in the
orchard,&mdash;men and boys carrying baskets
and ladders were coming; and to
the astonishment of the little tree, they
stopped under her boughs, placed the
ladders in the branches and climbed up.</p>

<p>"Good old apples!" cried one of the
boys, dropping them into his basket
with a plump.</p>

<p>"A fine yield!" said one of the men.
"Did you ever see anything more beautiful
than this rich golden brown?"</p>

<p>"The sweetest apple that ever grew!"
said another. "I don't feel that I've had
an apple till November brings these."</p>

<p>"It's a wise Providence that saves
this sweetest morsel for the last," declared
a third.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The little tree listened, trembling
with happiness. Could it be true?</p>

<p>She gazed at the fruit on her heavy
branches, and there, like drops of gold,
tinged with the sombre violet of November,
hung ball after ball of the
luscious sweetness.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she murmured, "how blest I
am to have so much to give, when all
the rest of nature is silent and sleeping.
How happy I shall be, and how
earnestly I will try to bear the sweetest
apples ever grown!"</p>

<p>At last the apples were all picked
and carried to the great bins in the
cellar, there to lie mellowing and sweetening
for the farmer's use during the
long winter months.</p>

<p>And the little russet apple tree went
to sleep, and took her long nap with
the rest.</p>
